# Course Service

The **Course Service** is responsible for managing course-related operations within the platform. This includes functionality for course creation, retrieval, and deletion, as well as filtering courses by specific criteria such as name or category.

## Key Features

- **Course Retrieval:** Fetch details of a course by ID, name, or category.
- **Course Creation:** Allow new courses to be created with a name, description, category, and module count.
- **Admin Operations:** Enable course deletion by administrators.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the service.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization capabilities.
- **Auth0 (JWT)**: For Decoding JWT.
- **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: For database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: Backend database for user data storage.
- **RESTful API Design**: Provides a clean and structured API interface.
- **Spring Cloud Eureka Client**

## Security
The service uses Spring Security to ensure endpoints are secured. All requests require authentication, and only authenticated users can interact with the endpoints.

|-------------|------------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------
